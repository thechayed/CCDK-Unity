The CCDK-Unity is a Toolkit that simplifies development of any kind of game by abstracting many elements into just a few Bolt nodes and Scriptable Objects, while still allowing for more complex extension through C#. 

While I will be adding a lot to this toolkit for my own use with my game Byte Sized Heroes, this may not be the best backend for your game's development. I will be created some Documentation on using it after I feel like it's at a solid enough point for total game creation.

Most of it's design is inspired by the Unreal Development Kit, which is pretty evident by the name.
