**To use the Toolkit, download the Latest Release and drag'n'drop the UnityPackage into your project.**

*Be Warned, the Tookit's Engine/Editor will automatically implement itself into your system. It is recommended that you try it out on a new project first, for testing.*

## Toolkit Outline:

## Future Plans: 
After completing all the systems in the Outline, the next steps will be to implement these tools to extend the Toolkit's functionality:
* UnityNEAT
* Yarn (The programming language for writing stories)

### If you have any feature requests that don't seem to already be included, please make an issue and I'll look into implementing it!
